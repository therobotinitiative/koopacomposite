Koopa Composite Java library for composite pattern
-----
Type safe composite pattern library that supports collection and
map based compositions. The library defines interfaces that can be
used to create the composition components.

Implementation classes are also provided for these interfaces. The
implementation classes are NOT thread safe!
-----
Works in progress. This library is NOT intended for production use yet.
The API might have dramatic changes before the first release version.
